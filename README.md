# Creating an AWS S3 Bucket

This Terraform template creates an S3 bucket in AWS. The bucket name is specified in `variables.tf`. The `prevent_destroy` lifecycle rule is set to true to prevent accidental deletion of the bucket.

To create the S3 bucket, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the bucket is created, the bucket name will be outputted.

Example output:

```
Outputs:

bucket_name = "my-bucket"
```

Useful commands:

- `terraform init`: Initializes the Terraform working directory.
- `terraform apply`: Applies the changes to the infrastructure.
- `terraform destroy`: Destroys the infrastructure.
